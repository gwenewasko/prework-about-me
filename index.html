      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is Gwen and I am a graphic designer, dog mom and an avid swimmer. I have been living in Chicago since September 2020 with my fiance, Blake and dog, Boone. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Originally from Incline Village, Nevada -- a small town located on the North Shore of Lake Tahoe.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm a huge bookworm, my goal is to finish 50 books by the end of the year. I also love swimming to stay active, and being outside with a beer in my hand is always my idea of a good time.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to not have to work at all (if I'm being honest), but if wishes were fishes -- I would move to small mountain town somewhere on the West Coast, open up a little coffeeshop/store and I would create cool stuff to sell so people could shop and drink coffee.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Chicago, IL in Bronzeville.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to learn more about web development because I have been a graphic designer for about 10 years specializing in branding and traditional design and I am looking to bolster my education in the digital space because ultimately I would really like to learn more about UI/UX design because how we interact with technology is very interesting to me and I believe it's a way we can make the world a better place.</p>
